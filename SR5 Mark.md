LINEAR SEARCH

Time Complexity:

- Time complexity: O(n) in the worst-case scenario.
- Explanation: Linear Search traverses through each element of the list sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list. Therefore,    the time taken to search increases linearly with the size of the list.

Space Complexity:
  
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Explanation: Linear Search does not require any additional space proportional to the size of the input list. It only uses a constant amount of space for           variables such as indices and temporary variables.

Big-O Notation:

-Efficiency: O(n).
-Explanation: Linear Search has a linear time complexity, meaning that the time taken to search increases linearly with the size of the input list. It is suitable  for small lists or unsorted arrays but may become inefficient for large datasets
