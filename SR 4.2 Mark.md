The algorith that perfims faster is Binary Search

Reason:
Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst-case scenario for sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found.

-Binary Search is highly efficient for large sorted arrays.
-It has a significantly lower time complexity compared to Linear Search for large datasets.
-It utilizes the sorted order of the list, which allows it to discard half of the elements at each step.
